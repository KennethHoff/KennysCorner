* [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
    * This is a Tiling Window Manager for Macs, inspired by [i3](https://i3wm.org/).
    * I bind all applications to specific keybinds, like for example [Microsoft Outlook](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/microsoft-outlook) on `option+8`, or [Slack](https://slack.com) on `option+5`.
    * This is the only way I move between applications.
* [<Icon class="inline" name="devicon:homebrew" size={20} /> Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    * This is the primary (unofficial) package manager for MacOS.
    * I use this to install GUI applications, like [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app).
* [<Icon class="inline" name="devicon:nixos" size={20} /> nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
    * This is the newest major program I've installed.
    * Similar to homebrew, this can be used to install applications, but it has another huge feature that I primarily
        use it for; It can install programs on a per-directory level by the use of something colloquially
        called a ["development flake"](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/development/intro). 
    * You can see the flake I used to create this website [here](https://github.com/KennethHoff/website/blob/master/flake.nix)
