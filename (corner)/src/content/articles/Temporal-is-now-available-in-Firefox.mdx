As of [Firefox 139](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/139.0/releasenotes/), 
[Temporal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal) is now supported in one of the three major browers.

Temporal is a re-imagining of the legacy `Date` API, which famously was based on original `java.util.Date` API from Java, which Java later replaced in the early 2010s. 
Among other things, it supports Timezones and Calendars. It also contains severals utility APIs for working with and displaying dates.
